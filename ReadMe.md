<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, we try to predic the parts of speech in a text file for all words. This is super useful for NLP applications. Possible applications:
- Identifying named entities

- Speech recognition

- Coreference Resolution



### Methodology

The project uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to model the relationship between words and their respective parts of speech. An HMM assumes that:

- Word = Observable variables and POS Tags = Hidden States
- The machine can only perceive the observable variable (words) and these variables only depend on the hidden states (POS Tags)
- The current state only depends on the previous state
- Transition probabilities determine the likelihood of moving from one POS tag to another.
- Emission probabilities define the likelihood of a word being associated with a specific POS tag.

To efficiently determine the most likely sequence of POS tags for a given sentence, the Viterbi algorithm is employed. It uses dynamic programming to compute the best sequence of states (tags) for the given observations (words) while considering transition and emission probabilities.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To use the project locally, just utilise the inference function in main.py for testing on personal data, you can also create your own model by using build_model function in main.py


### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Arnav6508/Parts-Of-Speech-Tagging
   ```

2. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
